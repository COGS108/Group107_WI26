    "Does a decline of 50% or more in average monthly players within the first 12 months after a game’s peak significantly predict whether a Steam game will experience a sustained collapse in player engagement, defined as falling to 5% of its peak concurrent players, within the following 24 months?\n"

    "Online multiplayer games depend on continued player engagements to justify the ongoing costs of server infrastructure, moderation, live updates and development support. These games require an active player base, and while engagement declines, companies must decide whether maintaining servers will be worth the commitment and resources used. There is yet to be a standardized, data driven benchmark that defines when a game has reached the point of sustained collapse. As a result, the threshold at which a game is considered no longer viable remains unclear. The lack of transparency creates uncertainty for players who are investing time and money without knowing how stable the game’s future truly is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Companies commonly consider several measurable factors when seeing whether to continue supporting certain titles. These can include concurrent player counts, monthly active users, retention rates, and the cost of maintaining development relative to revenue. Among these observable traits, player count is the most visible and consistently available metric, especially on platforms such as Steam. By tracking peaks and declines in concurrent players over time and often identify sharp falloffs following launch periods or major updates. In several live service cases, including MultiVersus, there is a noticeable pattern of an early peak followed by a rapid drop in players. While some decline after launch is expected, it is unclear at what point that decline signals long term collapse rather than normal market stabilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing research has approached this issue by modeling player retention and churn instead of defining a concrete collapse threshold. In Improved Retention Analysis in Freemium Role Playing Games by Jointly Modelling Players’ Motivation, Progression and Churn, the authors show that declining progression and reduced engagement are strong indicators that players are likely to stop playing altogether. Similarly, A Data Imputation Strategy to Enhance Online Game Churn Prediction, Considering Non Login Periods demonstrates that extended inactivity is a reliable predictor of permanent disengagement when properly modeled. These studies establish that measurable declines in engagement precede churn at the individual level. However, they do not define a population level benchmark that signals when a game as a whole is likely to experience sustained collapse. This gap motivates the present study, which tests whether a substantial early decline in average monthly players can serve as a measurable predictor of long term engagement deterioration across Steam multiplayer games.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
